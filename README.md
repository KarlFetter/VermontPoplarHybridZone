# VermontPoplarHybridZone

In Vermont, a narrow hybrid zone exists between *Populus balsamifera* (section tacamahaca) and *P. deltoides* (section aigerios). Fertile hybrids are found and backcrossing is known to occur in only 1 direction, from *balsamifera* hybrids into *balsamifera* parents. Both species are susceptible to a local strain of *Melampsora medusae*, a basidiomycete leaf rust that infects leaves via colonization of the mesophyll through stomata. In the hybrid zone, differential patterns of infection have been observed, with *P. deltoides* more susceptible to the pathogen than *P. balsamifera*. In this study, we describe the hybrid zone from the perspectives of genetic variation, disease dynamics, and condensed tanin variation. These data describe an ecological system defined thorugh its genetic, pathological, and chemical variation mediated by natural and human assisted gene flow.
